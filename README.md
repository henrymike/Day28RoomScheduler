# RoomScheduler

### How It Works
A calendar-booking tool that allows a room to be reserved for time and length on a single page using no more than 2 gestures. Also checks if a custom calendar already exists, and if not, creates one.

### Features
* Adds events in a custom-created calendar and automatically checks if that calendar already exists; if not, it creates it on the fly
* Time is pre-set to current time, so all the user has to do is select the meeting duration and tap ‘Schedule’ to book the room immediately
* Existing and newly created events display with a custom icon to denote the day they occur

### Future
* Allow more than one room to be booked
* Allow for color-coding of events based on category
* Allow events to be managed (edited/deleted) from within the app
